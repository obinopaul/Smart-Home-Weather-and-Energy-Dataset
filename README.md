# Tackling the Health Crises in Africa
==============================
                                                                    
The study surveyed a dataset containing records of deaths caused by numerous diseases asound the world. The analysis which was centered on Africa showed that of all the diseases recorded, six (6) were some of the most popular causes of death in Africa. They include:

1. **Cardiovascular Diseases**
2. **HIV/AIDS**
3. **Diarrheal Diseases**
4. **Lower Respiratory Infections**
5. **Neonatal Disorders**
6. **Malaria**

The study therefore reviewed three of these causes (Cardiovascular diseases, HIV/AIDS, Malaria) etc. 

|Cardiovascular Diseases|HIV/AIDS|Malaria|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Egypt - 5995471.0|South Africa	- 4874296.0|Nigeria	- 6422063.0|
|Nigeria - 4176488.0|Kenya -	2583539.0|Democratic Republic of Congo	- 2557219.0|
|Morocco - 2551096.0|Tanzania	- 2465047.0|Uganda	- 2557219.0|
|South Africa - 2234693.0|Nigeria	- 2216718.0|Burkina Faso -	950762.0|
|Algeria - 2123720.0|Uganda	- 2102167.0|Cote d'Ivoire	- 941597.0|

**Deaths caused by Cardiovascular Diseases in Africa**
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death in Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CVDs account for over 31% of all deaths in Africa, and this number is expected to increase in the coming years due to increasing risk factors such as unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and tobacco use.

**Deaths caused by HIV/AIDS in Africa**
 According to UNAIDS (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS), in 2020, approximately 38 million people were living with HIV globally, and the majority of these individuals (25.8 million) lived in sub-Saharan Africa. The region also accounts for the majority of deaths from AIDS-related illnesses, with an estimated 1.7 million deaths in 2020.

**Deaths caused by Malaria in Africa**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for over 90% of malaria cases and deaths globally. An estimated 409,000 malaria deaths occurred in the region in 2020. The high burden of malaria in Africa is due to a combination of factors, including limited access to malaria prevention and treatment services, insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and weak health systems

The study also visualized the increment in the number of deaths caused by these three diseases from 1990 to 2019 using both a line plot and a chloropleth map.

## Usage                                   
**Clone this repository to your local machine.**                                            
```bash     
git clone https://github.com/obinopaul/Tackling-the-Health-Crises-in-Africa.git                                     
```      

**Install the required packages.**                                                        
```bash    
pip install -r requirements.txt                         
```    
    
**Run the Jupyter notebook file Tackling_health_crises_in_Africa.ipynb**             
*The notebook contains detailed instructions and explanations of the code.*                             

## Data
The data used in this project was provided by (10analytics)[https://www.10alytics.io/] for their Data Aalytics competition in December, 2022.

## Results                                                                 
The average number of doctors per 10,000 people can vary greatly depending on various factors such as the country, region, or type of healthcare system. According to World Health Organization data from 2020, the average number of doctors per 10,000 people across the world is around 8.

From the data above, it can be seen that even though these countries have some of the top deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases, HIV/AIDS, and Malaria, they also have large number of doctors per 10,000 people. Asides Nigeria (with an average of 3-4 doctors per 10,000 people), the rest of the countries all have at least 7 medical doctors per 10,000 people. The issue therefore lies not in the availability of medical doctors, but could be the availability of wordclass medical facilities, government intervention, and the right strategies to combat these diseases.
